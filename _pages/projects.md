                <a href="/projects/eeg-cognition">Prediction of Multiple Cognitive Traits and Performance Based on Resting State EEG by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a>
            </h1>
            <hr> This project aims to create a connection between the EEG signal of a person and their performance in multiple clinical cognition tests using the power of deep neural networks.

                I started this project as an excuse to fully learn C++ and specifically to learn object-oriented C++. And what better excuse to learn a language than writing a game in it! And what better game to write than TETRIS!

            <p>
                A* is one the most well known pathfinding due its simplicity and efficiency. This was an attempt to implement this algorithm with VHDL in a smaller scale (10x10) to be able to make it synthesizable.

                A spherical solenoid consists of current-carrying rings that are wound in parallel on a spherical core.
                <br> This projects includes a calculator for calculating the magnetic field caused by this solenoid at any point in space as well as multiple graphs and plots all in form of a interactive GUI made by MATLAB App Designer.
