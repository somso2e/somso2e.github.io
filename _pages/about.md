Hi, I'm Sepand. I am a Medical Device Engineering Master's student at the University of Claude Bernard Lyon 1. I previously received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from K.N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran.

My passion is centered around the applications of **Machine Learning** and **Neural Networks** in medical image processing and analysis.

I'm well-versed in programming languages like **Python**, **C++** and **MATLAB**. I've developed countless Python projects focusing on broad subjects such as medical image visualization in [my bachelor thesis](projects/medvispy) and multiple neural networks projects which you can find more detail on my [CV](/cv/). I've also done multiple projects in C++ and MATLAB. I've put the source code and a short description of some of them on the [projects](/projects/) page.
