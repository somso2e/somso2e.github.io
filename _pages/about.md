Hi, I'm Sepand. I am a Medical Device Engineering Master student at University of Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My passion is centered around the transformative potential of **machine learning** and **neural networks** in the realm of medicine as well as **3D rendering** and **data visualization**. 

I'm well-versed in programming languages like **Python**, **C++** and **MATLAB**. I've developed countless Python projects focusing broad subjects such as medical image visualization in [my bacholer thesis](projects/medvispy) and multiple neural networks projects which you can find more detail on my [CV](/cv/). I've also done multiple projects in C++ and MATLAB. I've put the source code and a short description of some of them on the [projects](/projects/) page.
