Hi, I'm Sepand. I'm currently a last-year electrical engineer student at K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.


I'm interested in the use of Machine Learning and Neural Network in medecine, programming (C++, python, MATLAB and VHDL) and  digital electronics.

I've put the source code and a short description of some of my projects on my [projects](/projects/) tab. 

Welcome to my github page.
