        I started this project as an excuse to fully learn c++ and specifically to learn object-oriented c++. and what
        better excuse to learn a language than writing a game in it! and what better game to write than tetris!

        A spherical solenoid consists of current-carrying rings that are wound in parallel on a spherical core.
        <br> this projects includes a calculator for calculating the magnetic field caused by this solenoid at any point
        in space as well as multiple graphs and plots all in form of a interactive gui made by matlab app designer.

    <p>
        A* is one the most well known pathfinding due its simplicity and efficiency. this was an attempt to implement
        this algorithm with vhdl in a smaller scale (10x10) to be able to make it synthesizable.
