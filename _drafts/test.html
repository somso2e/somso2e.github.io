[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) is a classic 2D puzzle game from the 80's. The goal of this game is to complete a full line by dropping pieces, also known as "Tetrominoes". I decided to write this game as a practice to learn **C++** and
specifically **Object Oriented C++** as I was not confident enough at my C++ skills which I think is important for an electrical engineer. So I got to work. If you want to acually make a game that people want to play, I would advise you to use a commercial
game engine like Unity or Unreal. It would make your game way better and at the same time, make your job way easier. But since that was not my goal and I wanted a bit more of a challenge, I decided to make my own game engine! For the engine, I used the
[OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) graphics API since it seemed to be the easiest to work with for a beginner. However, it did not come with out its challenges. For starters, OpenGL is an old API developed in the 90's in C. It uses some unintiutive
system that uses pointers as _"objects"_ that need to be passed as a function parameter each time you call them. Trying to abstract this in to a modern C++ class was a big hassle and took a lot of head straching, research and trial and error. The next
big challenge was understanding how graphics rendering in GPUs works. After grasping concepts of vertex buffers, textures rendering, shaders and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and... I was able to create a "batch renderer" as well as dynamically rendering
text. A batch renderer groups all the API calls that would have otherwise been sent seperately to the GPU for each shape or texture in to a single API call for each frame. This technique greatly increases performance. With the renderer out of the way,
it is time for the easy part of the project. Writing the game itself! The game logic doesn't have any notable points to mention. Since it's a fairly simple game, it was pretty straight forward to develope. I even got some hardcore tetris player friends
of mines to playtest it for me. Their only complaints were a lack of custom hotkeys. So naturally I spent a few days developing a main menu and
